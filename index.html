            <p>Our school's mission is to learn leadership, the common core, and relationships for life. Our mission is to provide a safe, disciplined learning environment that empowers all students to develop their full potential. We feel strongly about helping to build leaders that have the ability to succeed in whatever endeavor they undertake. Winning is not always the measure of success. Our students understand the "Win, win" philosophy and use it in their daily life. Common standards keeps us focused on learning appropriate content and preparing our students to graduate. Last but just as importantly, setting examples for our students of meaningful and lasting relationships will go with them throughout their lifetime.

              As educators we want students to succeed from a safe distance. And as parents, we want our students to thrive. It's our job with all of our students (whether they're adults or students like you) to build a healthy and lasting relationship with their best friends. It's our great responsibility to work with you to develop an environment that fosters a healthy and strong personal connection between student and teacher. So as you work to build these relationships, it will be the hardest, best and most satisfying way to grow.
              
              The purpose of our mission is nothing less than to build trust, strengthen friendships and strengthen relationships with our students, our teachers and your educators. Each new student gets the same message we've given them with these actions.
